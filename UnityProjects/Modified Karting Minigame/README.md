This is a modified version of the kart game made for a game design class. Based on the Unity tutorial model, the goal of the assignment was to create our own version of the game. I chose to modify the textures and add several emitter effects, but there's a surprise when the player rounds the first corner. Using simple triggers to hide and unhide different assets, the player is teleported to different locations throughout the game.
