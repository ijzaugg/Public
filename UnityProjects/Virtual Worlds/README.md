The Virtual Worlds course introduced many of the concepts of designing and thinking about virtual spaces. While it focused largely on game design, the same techniques can be used in any virtual space.

Designs here include some of the first models I've created in Blender, including the very rough outline for a game called Blue Rabbit, White Bear demonstrating some of those assets inside of Unity.
